SUMMARY:
Maximum tested concurrency: 10000 concurrent connections
Server correctness rate: 100.0% (individual input-output validation)
Peak throughput: 379.11 ops/sec
Total test execution time: 373.848318866s (6.2 minutes)
Test methodology: Individual validation of each input against expected outcome
Input distribution: 50% conflicts, 20% unique, 10% edge cases, 10% invalid IPs, 10% invalid ports
Test levels: 50 100 250 500 750 1000 2000 3000 5000 10000

Note: Total execution time includes client-server communication, validation processing,
and system overhead (server startup/shutdown, process management, file I/O operations,
resource cleanup, memory/descriptor cleanup, cleanup verification between test levels).
