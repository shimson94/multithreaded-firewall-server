- **10% Edge Cases**: Boundary IPs (0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, 127.0.0.1)
- **10% Invalid IPs**: Malformed addresses (999.999.999.999, 256.1.1.1, not.an.ip)
- **10% Invalid Ports**: Out-of-range ports (-1, 99999, abc)

**Validation Methodology:**
- Individual input-output validation against expected responses
- Complete process failure tracking and diagnostic reporting
- Enhanced cleanup verification between test levels
- Parallel validation processing for high-load tests (76% performance improvement)

## Advanced Testing Capabilities

### Comprehensive Error Transparency

```
Process Monitoring:
✅ Client process failure tracking
✅ Server cleanup verification with retry logic  
✅ Missing output file detection
✅ Complete error categorisation (connection failures, invalid rules, empty responses)
✅ Process failure counts included in results
```

### Parallel Validation Processing

For test levels ≥2000 clients:
- **Parallel background validation** reduces processing time by 76%
- **10,000 client validation**: ~88s → ~21s improvement
- **Maintains 100% accuracy** while optimising execution time

### Enhanced Cleanup Verification

```c
verify_server_cleanup() {
    // Check for remaining server processes
    // Verify port cleanup completion
    // Retry up to 10 times with 0.5s delays
    // Force cleanup if verification fails
    // Report PASSED/FAILED status
}
```
